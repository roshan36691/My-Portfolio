# [ Project 1: Studying Ireland’s Climate Change Indices ](https://github.com/roshan36691/Dissertation)
I completed this project as a master's thesis for the Master's program in Ireland.

* Objective: Analysis of climate data to identify evolving trends in Temperature and Precipitation and compare Ireland's climate trends with other regions globally and also evaluate the influence of climate indices on ecological experiments and finally develop a user-friendly web app to visualize climate data and insights.
* Technologies used: Python, Shiny, Git.
* Data for Ireland is collected from [met.ie](https://www.met.ie/climate/climate-change-indices-etccdi)
* Data for Germany is collected from [opendata.dwd](https://opendata.dwd.de)
* Data for Jena Experiment is collected from [jexis](https://jexis.idiv.de/)
* Analyzed Ireland’s and Germany’s climate data using statistical methods like Mann-Kendall test and change point
analysis to uncover trends in temperature and precipitation.
* Explored the impact of climate changes on ecological systems, including analysis of the Jena Experiment, to link climatic
variables with ecosystem productivity.
* Created interactive maps and dashboards for data visualization.
* Developed a user-friendly web application using Shiny for interactive visualization of climate indices across multiple
regions [Climate_Data_Analysis](https://climatepredictions.shinyapps.io/apppy/)

# [ Project 2: Automated Data Pipeline ](https://github.com/roshan36691/Dissertation)

* Objective :To developed a web scraping strategy to collect, clean, and analyze automobiles data from a leading automobile website
* Technologies used: Python, BeautifulSoup, Matplotlib.
* Data was web scrapped from this website
* Used Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests to automate data extraction and processing.
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Pandas and Matplotlib, including generating summary statistics and
visualizations
* Delivered a structured, clean dataset and analytical insights.
