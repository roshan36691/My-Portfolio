# [Project 1: Studying Ireland’s Climate Change Indices] 
I completed this project as a master's thesis for the Master's program in Ireland.
* Technologies: Python, Shiny, Git
* Data for Ireland is collected from [met.ie](https://www.met.ie/climate/climate-change-indices-etccdi)
* Data for Germany is collected from [opendata.dwd](https://opendata.dwd.de)
* Data for Jena Experiment is collected from [jexis](https://jexis.idiv.de/)
* Analyzed Ireland’s and Germany’s climate data using statistical methods like Mann-Kendall test and change point
analysis to uncover trends in temperature and precipitation.
* Explored the impact of climate changes on ecological systems, including analysis of the Jena Experiment, to link climatic
variables with ecosystem productivity.
* Created interactive maps and dashboards for data visualization.
* Developed a user-friendly web application using Shiny for interactive visualization of climate indices across multiple
regions [Climate_Data_Analysis](https://climatepredictions.shinyapps.io/apppy/)
