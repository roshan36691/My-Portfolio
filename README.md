# [ Project 1: Studying Ireland’s Climate Change Indices ](https://github.com/roshan36691/Project-1-Studying-Ireland-s-Climate-Change-Indices)
I completed this project as a master's thesis for the Master's program in Ireland.

* Objective: Analysis of climate data to identify evolving trends in Temperature and Precipitation and compare Ireland's climate trends with other regions globally and also evaluate the influence of climate indices on ecological experiments and finally develop a user-friendly web app to visualize climate data and insights.
* Technologies used: Python, Shiny, Git.
* Data for Ireland is collected from [met.ie](https://www.met.ie/climate/climate-change-indices-etccdi)
* Data for Germany is collected from [opendata.dwd](https://opendata.dwd.de)
* Data for Jena Experiment is collected from [jexis](https://jexis.idiv.de/)
* Analyzed Ireland’s and Germany’s climate data using statistical methods like Mann-Kendall test and change point
analysis to uncover trends in temperature and precipitation.
* Explored the impact of climate changes on ecological systems, including analysis of the Jena Experiment, to link climatic
variables with ecosystem productivity.
* Created interactive maps and dashboards for data visualization.
* Developed a user-friendly web application using Shiny for interactive visualization of climate indices across multiple
regions [Climate_Data_Analysis](https://climatepredictions.shinyapps.io/apppy/)

# [ Project 2: Automated Data Pipeline ](https://github.com/roshan36691/Automated-Data-Pipeline)

* Objective : To developed a web scraping strategy to collect, clean, and analyze automobiles data from a leading automobile website
* Technologies used: Python, BeautifulSoup, Matplotlib.
* Data was web scrapped from this website [autocarindia](https://www.autocarindia.com/bikes/bikes-under-2-lakhs/3)
* Used Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests to automate data extraction and processing.
* Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Pandas and Matplotlib, including generating summary statistics and
visualizations
* Delivered a structured, clean dataset and analytical insights.

# [ Project 3: NBA Player Performance Prediction  ](https://github.com/roshan36691/Dissertation)

* Objective : To develop a performance prediction model of NBA players
* Technologies used: Python, Scikit-learn, Machine Learning
* Data was collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yakhyojon/national-basketball-association-nba)
* The machine learning techniques like Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Linear
Regression to forecast NBA player performance metrics such as rebounds per game.
* Analyzed an extensive NBA dataset, performing data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning to
enhance model accuracy.

# [ Project 4: Investment Dashboard for Unicorn Companies ](https://github.com/roshan36691/Project-4-Investment-Dashboard-for-Unicorn-Companies)

* Objective : To create a interactive investment dashboard for Unicorn Companies using Tableau.
* Technologies used: Python, Tableau
* Data was collected from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vineethakkinapalli/unicorn-companies-eda)
* Created visualizations that explored trends in valuation, geographical impact on investment, industry influence on
funding success, and the activity of top investors.
* Synthesized insights into a comprehensive dashboard, highlighting patterns such as regional investment concentrations,
industry-specific funding success, and key investor strategies.

# [ Project 5: Heart Disease Prediction System ](https://github.com/roshan36691/Project-4-Investment-Dashboard-for-Unicorn-Companies)
* Objective: To develop a predictive model to assess the risk of heart disease in individuals using clinical and demographic data.
* Technologies used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
* Data: Heart disease datasets were collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arezaei81/heartcsv)
* Implemented data preprocessing techniques including normalization and feature selection to enhance model performance.
Explored various machine learning models and systematically optimized them through hyperparameter tuning.
* Created visualizations to display the effectiveness of different models and their prediction accuracies, aiding in informed model selection.
* Achieved high prediction accuracy, offering potential use cases in medical diagnostics to support healthcare professionals in early intervention strategies.
